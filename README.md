![alt text](./Assets/yoder-monitor-all-1-5000.png "Saluminator BBQ Monitor Internet of Things (IoT) Appliance")

That is a big title! It describes the cool things that the device does. Here is a list of features…

- Monitor from 1 to 8 different zones in your BBQ (includes ambient temperature)
- You set the frequency to capture the temperature readings
- Transmit the telemetry to the cloud for visualizations, cook history and analysis
- Set the baseline temperature variance for each zone
- Configure rules and alerts that are triggered by your variance settings
- Load the telemetry from a previous cook to set variances
- Mobile monitoring and notifications
- Alexa integration “Alexa, what are the temperatures at BBQ Monitor #1?”

Let’s talk about the design and details. From here on out, we will refer to our hardware appliance as the <b>“BBQ Monitor”</b>.

The BBQ Monitor was designed to be open sourced and shared as a DIY project that most electromnic hobbiests or software developer can do. That said, maybe not all of the harder bits like CNC’n the project case, power-coating, soldering and labeling... and if that is help you need, we do offer up pieces you want from a kit that span all the way from the indiviudal boards to a fully completed appliance that we will ship to you. The BBQ Monitor is an advanced piece of kit and you need some software chops in order to bring the whole thing together. We will do our very best to explain things and be accurate in the details.

## HARDWARE

This is an "open hardware" project and you can easily order all of the components online.

We have documented the following for the hardware details...

- Complete bill of materials
- Overview of the [Controllers and Boards](./Docs/HARDWARE.md)
- Full wiring diagram
- All of the addtional components and how to connect
- CNC plans for the project case (we use Easel for the X-Carve CNC machine)
