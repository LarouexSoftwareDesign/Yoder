Let’s talk about the design and details. From here on out, we will refer to our hardware appliance as teh <b>“BBQ Monitor”</b>.

The BBQ Monitor was designed to be open sourced and shared as a DIY project that most electromnic hobbiests or software developer can do. That said, maybe not all of the harder bits like CNC’n the project case, power-coating, soldering and labeling... and if that is help you need, we do offer up pieces you want from a kit that span all the way from the indiviudal boards to a fully completed appliance that we will ship to you. The BBQ Monitor is an advanced piece of kit and you need some software chops in order to bring the whole thing together. We will do our very best to explain things and be accurate in the details.
